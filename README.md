# :performing_arts: Playwright with CodeceptJS

**Playwright** is a Node.js library by Microsoft for automating web browsers, offering a high-level API for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. It enables reliable end-to-end testing, browser automation, and user interaction.

**CodeceptJS** is an end-to-end testing framework that supports Playwright, WebDriver, and Puppeteer. It offers an easy-to-use API for testing web apps and supports various programming styles like BDD, TDD, and classical style.

Playwright and CodeceptJS make a strong combination for web automation. CodeceptJS has built-in plugins and utilities for testing web apps, including page objects, data-driven testing, and parallel execution. It supports running tests in multiple browsers and devices, making it ideal for cross-browser testing.

## About this mini project
In this mini project, I explored the combination of Playwright and CodeceptJS, two modern end-to-end testing frameworks that allow developers to write efficient and reliable automated tests for web applications. I tested the main functionalities of these tools and provided a step-by-step implementation guide for others who want to use them for testing their own web applications. 

The attached guide below (in Hungarian) covers everything from setting up the environment and installing the necessary dependencies, to writing and running tests using CodeceptJS and Playwright. 

Overall, this mini project demonstrates the power and simplicity of using Playwright and CodeceptJS for automated testing.
